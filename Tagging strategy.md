# Tagging Strategy

This document outlines the tagging strategy for resources in the Azure-Cost-Management-Lab assignment, created on March 10, 2025.

## Tags
| Tag Key       | Tag Value | Purpose                          |
|---------------|-----------|----------------------------------|
| Environment   | Test      | Indicates a testing environment |
| Department    | IT        | Identifies the IT department    |

## Strategy
- **Purpose**: Tags are applied to all Azure resources (VMs, SQL Database, storage, etc.) to enable cost tracking and resource management.
- **Application**: Tags will be assigned during resource creation or via the Azure Portal under "Tags" for existing resources.
- **Benefits**: Facilitates filtering in Cost Analysis and ensures accountability by department.

## Summary
The tagging strategy uses `Environment: Test` and `Department: IT` to organize and monitor resources effectively in a test environment managed by the IT department.
