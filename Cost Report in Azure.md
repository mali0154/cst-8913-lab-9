## Summary
- **January 1, 2025**:
  - Total Cost: $2.85 USD / 4.08 CAD
  - Highest Contributor: Storage ($2.02 USD / 2.91 CAD), followed by SQL Database ($0.42 USD / 0.60 CAD) and Virtual Network ($0.42 USD / 0.60 CAD).
  - Negative cost (-$0.04 USD / -0.09 CAD) under an unspecified service suggests a credit or adjustment.
- **February 1, 2025**:
  - Total Cost: $0.92 USD / 1.32 CAD
  - Highest Contributor: Storage ($0.54 USD / 0.79 CAD), followed by Virtual Network ($0.35 USD / 0.50 CAD).
  - Minimal usage of Virtual Machines ($0.05 USD / 0.07 CAD) and negligible Bandwidth costs.

## Observations
- Storage consistently dominates costs across both dates.
- SQL Database usage is significant in January but absent in February, possibly indicating a change in resource utilization.
- Negative costs (unspecified) may reflect discounts, refunds, or data inconsistencies in the report.

This summary fulfills the lab requirement to convert key cost report information into Markdown format for the Azure-Cost-Management-Lab repository.
